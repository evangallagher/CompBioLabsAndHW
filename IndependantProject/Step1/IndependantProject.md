# How Species Characteristics Affect Local Extinctions of Kalamazoo 

## Introduction

Extinction is a global problem, with global species going extinct at an ever increasing rate. This problem is hard to address with no real understanding of the underlying causes of extinction. One method of understanding why this is happening is to look at species in a given area and compare basic characteristics to see if there are any similarities between species currently extinct or on the track to be. 

The researchers of the Journal of Botany used this exact method to see if they could answer this question. They took local flora species of Kalamazoo County in Michigan, USA and compared plant species to try and find characteristics potentially linked with an increased extinction rate. I plan to use their vast database with multiple defining characteristics to see if there are any significant links between basic characteristics and extinction rates.

## Summary of Data to be Analyzed



### Goals of original study that produced the data 
The goal of this study was to understand extinction through looking at vulnerable species and trying to link basic characteristics to increased extinction rates. The purpose of doing a study like this is to hopefully come to significant conclusions of what could contribute to extinction, which would help predict species that are more at risk for extinction in the future. Studies like this are potentially ecologically beneficial which makes them important.  

### Brief description of methodology that produced the data
A wide range of flora in Kalamazoo county in Michigan were examined for a few basic characteristics, given a 0 if extinct, or a 1 if not, and rarity was calculated for 1,137 species. The various characteristics were; species, family, status, habitat association, life history (annual or perennial), growth form(forb, woody), native or non-native, range edge, number of unique habitats found in, photosynthetic pathway, and finally rarity.   

### Type of data in this data set:  
Mostly categorical. In every category except for rarity each species is assigned a categorical variable, with extinction being labeled as a 0 or 1. Rarity was calculated through outside means the paper does not go over and is the only numerical value. 

#### Format of data  
Most of the important data is found in a single csv file, with an additional text file outlining phylogenetic relationships as well as a readme file explaining the csv. 

#### Size of data (i.e., megabytes, lines, etc.)
The csv file is 123 kb large with 1,137 lines long and 15 blocks wide. 

#### Any inconsistencies in the data files?  Anything that looks problematic?  
The only weird part of this data set I can see is they do not explain what the block titled "Nfix" is and they do not discuss it in the conclusions either which leads me to believe it was excluded from final results. 

#### What the data represent about the biology? 
The largest significance of this data set would be ideally to link common characteristics of plants to how likely they are to go extinct. Significant conclusions would be relevant to many future environmental conservation efforts.

## Detailed Description of Analysis to be Done and Challenges Involved

The largest challenge of this dataset is to take these variables and try and relate them into a statistical analysis of relation to extinction. Basic statistical analysis tests like T-test or ANOVA should be useful here, but relating all of these variables in one large test to find the characteristic most closely related to extinction is where I feel the most challenge is. This is both a very large file with over 1,000 lines and 11 different characteristics to all take into consideration.
